### Hi, I'm Afif 👋🏼👷🏼

As a university student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering, I combine the knowledge of software with hardware to create new ideas that can benefit society. I enjoy tinkering with electronic devices such as Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi. I am also developing my coding skills with Python and C++.
